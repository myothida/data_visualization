# Image Directory Description

This directory contains a collection of images used to evaluate the **effectiveness of data visualizations**. The images include both **effective** and **ineffective** examples, supporting visual analysis and discussion on best practices in data presentation.

## Purpose

This directory is used for:

- Teaching and evaluating **data visualization principles**
- Comparing effective vs. ineffective visual representations
- Supporting lessons on **visual literacy**, **chart selection**, and **design ethics**


## Categories

The images can be:

- **effective/**: Graphs and charts that demonstrate clear, accurate, and insightful data visualization principles.
- **wrong_chart/**: Examples where the chosen chart type is inappropriate for the data (e.g., using a pie chart for time series).
- **wrong_type/**: Visualizations that use the wrong form entirely (e.g., using a line chart for categorical data).
- **wrong_content/**: Charts that contain misleading, confusing, or incorrect content (e.g., truncated axes, misleading scales, incorrect labels).
- **ambiguous/**: Charts that are not clearly right or wrong, useful for class discussion or nuanced evaluation.


# Data Visualization Effectiveness Checklist

Use the following checklist to evaluate whether a data visualization is **effective**. An effective visualization communicates the intended message **clearly, accurately, and ethically**.

## ✅ Clarity
- [ ] Is the main message or insight of the visualization clear at a glance?
- [ ] Are labels, legends, and axes easy to read and understand?
- [ ] Is the chart free of unnecessary clutter (e.g., 3D effects, too many colors)?

## ✅ Appropriate Chart Type
- [ ] Is the chart type appropriate for the data (e.g., line for trends, bar for categories)?
- [ ] Does it avoid misleading types (e.g., pie chart for many small values or time series)?
- [ ] Is it easy to compare values or trends visually?

## ✅ Accuracy and Honesty
- [ ] Are the axes scaled and labeled correctly (no misleading truncation)?
- [ ] Is the data accurately represented without distortion or manipulation?
- [ ] Are any transformations or aggregations of the data clearly explained?

## ✅ Context and Completeness
- [ ] Is there enough context to interpret the visualization (title, source, units)?
- [ ] Are comparisons meaningful and based on relevant groupings or categories?
- [ ] Does the chart avoid cherry-picking or omitting important data?

## ✅ Accessibility and Design
- [ ] Are color choices accessible to colorblind users (use of patterns or contrast)?
- [ ] Is the font readable and of sufficient size?
- [ ] Are visual elements (bars, lines, dots) appropriately sized and spaced?

## ✅ Insightfulness
- [ ] Does the chart reveal something meaningful or useful about the data?
- [ ] Is there an appropriate level of complexity—not too simple, not overwhelming?
- [ ] Could this visualization help inform a decision or understanding?

Students should aim to justify their evaluation using this checklist. For ambiguous cases, discussion and reasoning are encouraged—there may not be a single "correct" answer.
